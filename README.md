# AI Medical Chatbot Server

This project is an AI assistant designed to support doctors by providing fast, reliable, and context-aware medical information. The chatbot leverages advanced language models and modern tooling to offer conversational assistance, help with medical queries, and integrate seamlessly into clinical workflows.

## 🚀 Features

- **Contextual Medical Conversations**: Engages with users using medical terminology and understands follow-up questions.
- **Domain-Specific Knowledge**: Tailored for healthcare and medical applications.
- **Framework Integration**: Built using LangChain and LangGraph for powerful conversational AI pipelines.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily extendable with new data sources, models, and plug-ins.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **LangChain**: For managing language model prompts, memory, and agent workflows.
- **LangGraph**: For building and visualizing reasoning graphs and complex workflows.
- **Python **: The primary programming language version `3.12.1`
